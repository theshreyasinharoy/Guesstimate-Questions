# Calculate the annual revenue of a popular fast-food chain in India

Population of India = 1,500,000,000

Youth Population = 40% of Total = 60,000,000

Adult Population = 65% of Total = 9,75,000,000

### During normal days: -  

Youth Consumption- 4 times/month

Adult Consumption- 2 times/month

Cost of 1 item = Rs. 500/-

Total Revenue from Youth = 60,000,000 x 4 x 500 = Rs.  12 0000000000

Total Revenue from Adult = 9,75,000,000 x 2 x 500 = Rs. 9,75,000,000,000

### Birthday Parties: -

No. of parties/year = 50,000


No. of items/party = 150

Cost/item = Rs. 300

Total Revenue from Bday parties = 50,000 x 150 x 300 = Rs. 2,250,000,000

### Year End Parties: -

No. of parties/year = 5000

No. of Orders/party = 300

Cost/item = Rs. 500

Total Revenue = 5000 x 300 x 500 = Rs. 7,50,000,000

### Miscellaneous Celebrations (Corporate parties, reunions, small house parties, dates): -

No. of parties/year = 50,000

No. of orders/party = 60

Cost/ item = 500

Total Revenue = 50,000 x 60 x 500 = Rs. 1,50,00,00,000

### Total annual Revenue of the fast-food chain in India = 1,2 0,000,000,000 + 9,75,000,000,000 + 2,250,000,000 + 7,50,000,000 + 1,50,00,00,000 = Rs. 10,99,50,00,00,000  = Rs. 134.15 Billion
